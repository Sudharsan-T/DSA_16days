## 🚀 Purpose & Approach

Algorithms are the foundation of efficient programming and critical to solving real-world problems. This repo serves as a sandbox where I:

- Implement classical and modern algorithms in Python  
- Explore algorithmic problem solving with increasing complexity  
- Optimize solutions for performance and readability  
- Use Jupyter notebooks to visualize and explain key concepts interactively

By actively coding and refining these algorithms, I’m building a solid skillset that translates to practical software development and competitive programming.
